description: "Armageddon 2419 A.D. is a science fiction novella by Philip Francis\
  \ Nowlan which first appeared in the August 1928 issue of the pulp magazine Amazing\
  \ Stories. A sequel called The Airlords of Han was published in the March 1929 issue\
  \ of Amazing Stories. Both stories are now in the public domain in the US according\
  \ to the Project Gutenberg website. In the 1960s, Nowlan's two novellas were combined\
  \ by editor Donald A. Wollheim into one paperback novel, titled Armageddon 2419\
  \ A.D. The characters and setting eventually evolved into Buck Rogers.\n From Wikipedia\
